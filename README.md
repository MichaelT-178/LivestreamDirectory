## [Link to Website](https://michaelt-178.github.io/LivestreamDirectory/)
This is a search tool I made for the Youtuber "Corey Heuvel". Allows users to easily navigate thousands of livestream music performances. This website is currently being hosted on GitHub pages.

Here's Corey Heuvel talking about the Livestream Directory during one of his livestreams: [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/bEBVkT9SWFY?feature=share&t=2937)

Note: I'm the "Michael L" being referred to, that's my Youtube username. The L doesn't stand for anything.
